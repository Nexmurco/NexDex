Damage Formula
(((((((Level × 2 ÷ 5) + 2) × BasePower × [Sp]Atk ÷ 50) ÷ [Sp]Def) × Mod1) + 2) × CH × Mod2 × R ÷ 100) × STAB × Type1 × Type2 × Mod3)


Level
    The user's current level.
BasePower
    The move's Base Power (after performing all necessary modifiers to it... see Section 2).
[Sp]Atk
    The user's Attack or Special Attack stat (after performing all necessary modifiers to it... see Section 3). If the move used is physical, the Attack stat is utilized; otherwise, the Special Attack stat is used.
[Sp]Def
    The foe's Defense or Special Defense stat (after performing all necessary modifiers to it... see Section 4). If the move used is physical, the Defense stat is utilized; otherwise, the Special Defense stat is used.
Mod1
    The first modifier to the damage formula. See Section 5 for more details.
CH
    3 if the move is a critical hit and the user has the Sniper ability, 2 if the move is a critical hit and the user's ability is not Sniper, and 1 otherwise.
Mod2
    The second modifier to the damage formula. See Section 6 for more details.
R
    (100 - Rand), where Rand is a random whole number between 0 and 15 inclusive with uniform probability. This produces a whole number between 85 and 100 inclusive, with uniform probability.
STAB
    2 if the move is of the same type as that of the user and the user has the Adaptability ability, 1.5 if the move is of the same type as that of the user and the user's ability is not Adaptability, and 1 otherwise. This is known as Same Type Attack Bonus (hence STAB).
Type1
    2 if the move is super effective against the first type of the foe, 0.5 if the move is not very effective against the first type of the foe, 0 if the move type does not affect the first type of the foe, and 1 otherwise.
Type2
    2 if the move is super effective against the second type of the foe, 0.5 if the move is not very effective against the second type of the foe, 0 if the move type does not affect the type of the foe, and 1 otherwise (or if the foe has only one type).
Mod3
    The third modifier to the damage formula. See Section 7 for more details. 



---------------------------------------------------
Base Power

BasePower = HH × BP × IT × CHG × MS × WS × UA × FA
	
HH
    1.5 if the move has been boosted by the move Helping Hand by the partner, and 1 otherwise.
BP
    The Base Power of the move. This is usually found easily, like 80 for Energy Ball, 60 for Aerial Ace, etc. Some moves have a variable BP, a list of which is given in Section 2A.
IT
    The item multiplier. The list of items that affect Base Power, together with their effects, is given in Section 2B.
CHG
    2 if the Pokemon's last move was Charge and this move's type is Electric and 1 otherwise.
MS
    0.5 if one of the Pokemon in play used the move Mud Sport and this move's type is Electric, and 1 otherwise.
WS
    0.5 if one of the Pokemon in play used the move Water Sport and this move's type is Fire, and 1 otherwise.
UA
    The user ability multiplier. A list of user abilities that affect Base Power, together with their effects, is given in Section 2C.
FA
    The foe ability multiplier. A list of foe abilities that affect Base Power, together with their effects, is given in Section 2D.
------------------------------------------------------
	
Attack
SpAttack 
= Stat x SM x AM x IM

SM
    The stat modifier multiplier. See Section 3A for more information.
AM
    The ability modifier. See Section 3B for a list of abilities that change the attacking stats.
IM
    The item modifier. See Section 3C for a list of items that change the attacking stats.


--------------------------------------------


[Sp]Def = Stat × SM × Mod × SX

where:

Stat
    The normal Defense or Special Defense stat.
SM
    The stat modifier multiplier. See Section 3A for more information.
SX
    0.5 if the move used by the user is Selfdestruct or Explosion, otherwise 1.
Mod
    A modifier depending on a few factors. These are as follows: 


-----------------------------------------------------------


Mod1 = BRN × RL × TVT × SR × FF


BRN
    The Burn modifier
RL
    The Reflect/Light Screen modifier
TVT
    The 2v2 modifier
SR
    The Sunny Day/Rain Dance modifier
FF
    The Flash Fire modifier 


------------------------------------------------------------------

Mod2 is

    1.3 if the user is holding the item Life Orb.
    1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, ..., 2 if the user is holding the item Metronome and has used the same move once, twice, three times, four times, ... etc. consecutively.
    1.5 if the user is attacking with the move Me First.
    1 otherwise.

In the case when the Pokemon is using Me First and is also holding the item Life Orb or Metronome, the item boost multiplier is done first, followed by the Me First (x1.5) multiplier.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Mod3 = SRF × EB × TL × TRB

where:

SRF
    The Solid Rock/Filter modifier
EB
    The Expert Belt modifier
TL
    The Tinted Lens modifier
TRB
    The type-resisting Berry modifier

SRF is 0.75 if the foe's ability is Solid Rock or Filter and the move used is super effective against it, and 1 otherwise.

EB is 1.2 if the user is holding the item Expert Belt and the move used is super effective against the foe, and 1 otherwise.

TL is 2 if the user's ability is Tinted Lens and the move used is not very effective against the foe, and 1 otherwise.

TRB is:

    0.5 if the foe is holding one of the type resisting Berries and the move used is super effective and of the same type as the type that the Berry knocks down.
    0.5 if the foe is holding Chilan Berry and the move used is Normal-type.
    1 otherwise.

Remember once again that the multiplication must be carried out in the order listed above.


------------------------------------------------------------------
The eighth and final section will concern moves that do not follow the damage formula to the rule.

    Doom Desire and Future Sight use a slightly different variation of the damage formula for the calculation of the damage dealt two turns after they are used. They use the Special Defense stat of the foe that was targeted when the move was used. Type1 and Type2 are also both equal to 1 irrespective of the type of the Pokemon that is being dealt damage.
    When Spit Up is used, the variable R in the damage formula (i.e. the random number between 85 and 100) is always taken to be 100.
    Pain Split does not even do damage. The user's remaining HP and that of the foe are averaged and rounded down, and then both are set to this value.
    There are certain moves that do not use the usual damage formula to determine the damage done to the foe. Here is a list of them, and how to determine the damage dealt by each:

    Bide
        Damage is equal to twice the damage received during the last two turns to the last Pokemon attacking the user.
    Counter
        Damage is equal to twice the damage received from the last Pokemon attacking the user during that turn, if the move used was physical.
    Dragon Rage
        Damage is always 40.
    Endeavor
        Damage is equal to the foe's remaining HP minus the user's remaining HP. It fails if this number is not positive.
    Fissure, Guillotine, Horn Drill and Sheer Cold
        Damage is equal to the foe's maximum HP (even if the foe is behind a substitute, in which case this amount of damage is dealt to the substitute instead).
    Metal Burst
        Damage is equal to 1.5 times the damage received from the last Pokemon attacking the user during that turn. Fails if that Pokemon is your partner.
    Mirror Coat
        Damage is equal to twice the damage received from the last Pokemon attacking the user during that turn, if the move used was special.
    Night Shade
        Damage is equal to the user's Level.
    Psywave
        Damage is equal to (R + 5) × Level ÷ 10, rounded down, where R is a random whole number between 0 and 10 inclusive with uniform probability, and Level is the user's Level.
    Seismic Toss
        Damage is equal to the user's Level.
    SonicBoom
        Damage is always 20.
    Super Fang
        Damage is equal to half the foe's remaining HP, rounded down. (If this damage is 0, it becomes 1 instead.)
