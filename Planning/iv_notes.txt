take highest iv modulo 5

in case of tie, take personality value modulo 6 to give a starting place to find which stat to use first
    (0)hp -> (1)attack -> defense -> speed -> spatk -> (5)spdef -> (0)hp
    if there was a tie between defense and speed for example we could check for personality value, and if it gave 0 then we would choose defense first
